I realized I kept missing new KHH releases cuz I was too lazy to check Reddit. This app pulls all the new posts from r/khiphop that has the "MusicVideo" flair and aggregates them onto a single page. 

TODO:
- [ ] Fix Mobile Styles
- [ ] Add second route for K-Pop
- [ ] Restructure App for multiple pages
- [ ] Some Spotify integration
